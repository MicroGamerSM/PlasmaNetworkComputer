Hello, World!
This is a <#a0f>PWML<#fff> document, or Plasma Web Markup Document! It's like rich text, but can hold lua code to be ran!
<u>It also lets you use buttons, and scripts that run on page load.</u>
<button payload="Test">Test</button>
<lua RunOnPayload="Test">
print("Hello, World!")
</lua>
When you hit the button above, make sure to check the console window!
